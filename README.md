# Summary

Jippi is a simple informational website which uses stateless React components to render each page. These integrate with the Mailchimp API in order to link sign up forms for caputuring prospective user information. The Jippi MVP is designed to confirm the value proposition for a side project idea prior to further development.

Jippi was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
