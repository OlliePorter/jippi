        <p>2. Information we collect</p>
        <p>2.1. We may collect information, including personal information, about you when you provide it to us, when you use our Sites, products, and services, and when other sources provide it to us, as further described below. Personal information means information that can be associated with a specific individual.</p>
        <p>2.2. We process the following categories of personal information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Information provided directly by you</p></li>
          <li><p>Information received from other sources</p></li>
          <li><p>Information collected automatically</p></li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p><strong>Information provided directly by you</strong></p>
        <p>Account and user information. We collect information about you when you register an account, create or modify user information, and/or provide any other related information to access or use our Sites, products, or services. For example, you provide your email address when you join our mailing list on our Site. If you use our Sites, products, or services, we may also process, without limitation, the following information: name (pseudonym or nickname), telephone number (e.g., in cases when you request individual technical support or assistance), and information about your purchases and activation of the Applications (preference categories and other types of preference-related advertising).</p>
        <p>Information you provide by filling out specific forms. Jippi also processes personal information you provide by filling out specific forms. For example, when downloading a beta version of an Application from the Site, subscribing to email newsletters, contacting Jippi for technical support or via feedback forms, etc., Jippi may set out the requirements for the information that is essential to provide the user with our products or services. For instance, for technical support purposes you may be asked to provide your contact information, a description of the problem you are experiencing, and documentation, screenshots, or information that would be helpful in resolving the issue. If some information is not marked by Jippi as essential, you may submit or disclose such information at your own discretion.</p>
        <p>Commercial and payment information. If you purchase our products or services, we may process the following information: your name, email address, your country, state, city, postal code, information about your purchases, payment methods, payment currencies, and other payment data. If you use a credit card to purchase a Jippi product, the credit card number is encrypted as it passes over the Internet. Cardholder data is not kept in or recorded by Jippi, it is simply transferred to your bank, credit card company, and payment-processing company. In this respect, an online credit card purchase is similar to a credit card purchase at any store. Information about you such as name, email address, your country, state, city, postal code, and purchased product or service is retained by Jippi for further delivery and/or registration of the product or service.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p><strong>Information received from other sources</strong></p>
        <p>Information received from distributors or partners. We may obtain personal information about you from our distributors or partners, for example, if you purchase the products or services through one of these partners. The personal information we may receive includes business contact information, including name, surname, job titles, and email addresses. Please note that Jippi acts as a processor with respect to the information received from distributors or partners.</p>
        <p>Information received from Business administrators. We may obtain personal information about you from Business administrators, for example, if the Business would like to share its license rights with you, such Business may provide us with your email so that we can grant you the foregoing rights.</p>
        <p>Information received from payment processors. When you save your credit card information, it is saved on the respective payment processor's servers and the payment processor gives Jippi a token that you can reuse for future payments. It is not possible to reconstruct your credit card information from the token. For due performance of our tax obligations and for subscription renewal, we may only obtain the following information from our payment processors: the last 4 digits of the credit card associated with your purchase, the country of the bank that issued the card, the network, and expiration month and year.</p>

        <p>5.1. We share information we collect about you in the ways discussed below.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p><strong>Service Providers.</strong> We share your personal information with third-party service providers that help us operate, provide, improve, integrate, customize, support and market our Sites, Applications, and services. Following our instructions, these parties may process your personal information in the course of providing the relevant services to us. Third-party service providers only have access to the personal information they need to perform those services. In particular, we use third-party service providers of payment processing, fraud prevention, crash reporting services, analytics services, marketing services, advertising services, email communication and customer support services, and hosting and other information technology services.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Partners.</strong> We may share your information with our partners that help us to drive traffic to our Sites or otherwise promote our Applications and services, as well as with our Bitcoin rewards partner Joltz.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Business administrators.</strong> If you are using the Application activation key that is provided to you by a Business or if you were invited to use the Jippi Site, services, and products by a Business, we may provide your email, Application activation information, Application use status (last use date) and operating system information to the relevant Business administrators for license management purposes.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Business transfers.</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of all or a portion of our assets, or transition of a service to another provider, your personal information and other information may be transferred to a successor or affiliate as part of that transaction.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Compelled disclosure.</strong> We reserve the right to use or disclose your personal information if required by law or if we reasonably believe that use or disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or comply with a law, court order, or legal process.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Others.</strong> We may share your personal information in other ways if you have asked us to do so or have given consent. For example, with your consent, we post user testimonials that may identify you.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>5.2. These transfers will be typically based on our legitimate interest or agreed upon in the contract.</p>
        <p>5.3. If you prefer that we not share your information with third parties for marketing purposes, please contact our Support Team.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>6. Retention of personal information</p>
        <p>If we collect your personal information, the length of time we retain it is determined by a number of factors, including the purpose for which we use that information and our obligations under applicable laws, but no longer than it is reasonably necessary in light of the purposes set out above. We may need your personal information to establish, bring, or defend legal claims. For this purpose, we retain your personal information for 7 years after the date it is no longer needed by us for any transactions, fulfilling contract purposes or marketing communications.</p>

      <section>
        <p>7. Cookie notice</p>
        <p>7.1. This notice is designed to help you understand what cookies are, how Jippi uses them, and the choices you have in regard to their use. By continuing to use our Sites, you are agreeing to the use of cookies in the manner described in this notice.</p>
        <p>7.2. What are cookies?</p>
        <p>Cookies are small text files that are stored in your browser or on the hard drive of your computer or another device when you visit our Site. This allows the Site to recognize you as a user either for the duration of your visit (a “session cookie”) or for repeat visits (a “persistent cookie”). Cookies are not harmful and do not contain any personally identifiable information such as your home address, date of birth, or credit card details.</p>
        <p>7.3. The cookies we use fall into four broad types:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Strictly necessary cookies.</strong> These cookies are essential for helping you to navigate our Site and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the Site. Without these cookies, the services you have requested, such as setting up an account, cannot be provided. These cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you've been on the Internet.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Analytical/performance cookies.</strong> In order to keep the Site, services, and products relevant, easy to use, and up to date, we use web analytics services to help us understand how people use our Site. For example, we can see which parts of the Site and products are most popular, identify when and where errors occur, and test different versions of a page or feature to see which works best.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Functionality cookies.</strong> These cookies allow websites and applications to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language, or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personalized features. The information these cookies collect is usually anonymized, which means we cannot identify you personally. They do not gather any information about you that could be used for selling, advertising, or remembering where you've been on the Internet but help us provide advertising that is more relevant to you.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Targeted marketing cookies.</strong> We also use cookies to assist in targeted advertising. Without these cookies, online advertisements you encounter will be less relevant to you and your interests. We also use them to measure the effectiveness of our marketing communications, for example, by receiving signals to inform us if you have responded to an advertisement that we have sent you.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>7.4. The information stored in cookies is safe and anonymous to any external third party, and your account security is never compromised. For information on how to disable cookies, please consult the “Help” tab in your browser via its menu bar. Should you need further assistance, please contact us via the email address below.</p>

      <section>
        <p>8. Your consent to receive information from Jippi</p>
        <p>8.1. Our Site and Applications offer news and information regarding our products by subscription, including email newsletters. If you decide to subscribe to these services, you may be asked to provide your email address and name. By doing so, you agree to receive emails from Jippi with information about updates and any other information related to the Applications as well as other types of information from Jippi, including advertisements. We may use the information you provide to help develop content that is relevant to our users. You are free to cancel your subscription(s) at any time.</p>
        <p>8.2. Where required by law we will only send you marketing information if you consent to us doing so at the time you provide us your personal information. You may opt out of receiving such emails by following the instructions in each promotional email we send you.</p>
        <p>8.3. To cancel your subscription, follow the instructions at the bottom of the emails or email us at hello@jippi.app and request the deletion of your data from our mailing list. In this case, Jippi will keep your personal information in its database but will not contact you unless you change your mind on this issue.</p>

      <section>
        <p>9. Protection of your information</p>
        <p>9.1. Jippi stores information about users and takes the appropriate organizational and technical security measures to protect that information from unauthorized access and disclosure in compliance with internal rules and procedures (including GDPR).</p>
        <p>9.2. We maintain administrative and technical safeguards for the protection of personal information. These safeguards include, without limitation, the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Administrative safeguards:</strong> Access to personal information about users is limited to authorized personnel who have a legitimate need to know it based on their job descriptions – for example, employees who provide technical support to end users. All such data is subject to password protection. In the case of third-party contractors who process personal information on our behalf, similar requirements are imposed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>9.3. If you create an account, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password for that account.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>10. Your rights</p>
        <p>Under data protection law as the data subject, you have rights we need to make you aware of. The rights available to you depend on our reason for collecting and processing your information.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p><strong>Right of access.</strong> You have the right to ask us for copies of your personal information. This right always applies. However, there are some exceptions, when you may not always receive all the information we process about you.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Right to rectification.</strong> You have a right to ask us to correct or complete your personal information if you find that it is inaccurate or incomplete. If we share your personal information with others, we will ask them to correct or complete it as soon as it is possible.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Right to erasure.</strong> You may ask us to delete your personal information in certain circumstances, for example, if your personal information is no longer needed for its processing or if you want to withdraw your consent. If we share your personal information with others, we will notify them that they need to erase your information where it is possible.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Right to restriction of processing.</strong> You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your data in cases determined by law.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Right to object to processing.</strong> You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal information, under certain conditions.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Right to data portability.</strong> You have the right to request that we transfer the information that we have collected to another organization or directly to you, under certain conditions.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Right to withdraw a consent.</strong> If we rely on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time, but this will not affect any processing of your data that has already taken place.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Right to make a complaint with a supervisory authority.</strong> We work to high standards when it comes to processing your personal information. If you have queries or concerns, please contact us at hello@jippi.app and we'll respond. If you have a concern about our privacy practices, including the way we handle your personal information, you can report it to the data protection authority that is authorized to hear those concerns.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Right to non-discrimination.</strong> We will not discriminate against you (e.g., through denying provision of products or services or providing a different level or quality of products or services) for exercising any of the rights available to you.</p></li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>11. Other important privacy information</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p><strong>Sensitive information.</strong> Jippi does not collect sensitive personal information such as sexual preferences, religion, political views, health conditions, or other sensitive personal information. We will not request it from you, and neither do we need it.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Data on children.</strong> Persons under the age of 13, or any higher minimum age in the jurisdiction where that person resides, should not provide us with personal information unless they have the verifiable permission of their parent(s) or legal guardian(s). Our Site, products, and services are not intended for children under the age of 13 or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children but, if a parent, guardian, or anyone else believes that a child has submitted personal information to us and would like us to delete that information, they may contact us at hello@jippi.app.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>International transfers of personal information.</strong> We collect information globally and may transfer, process, and store your information outside of your country of residence, to wherever we or our third-party service providers operate for the purpose of providing you our products and services. Whenever we transfer your information, we take steps to protect it. To facilitate our global operations, we transfer information globally and allow access to that information from countries in which Jippi owned or operated companies have operations for the purposes described in this Policy. These countries may have data protection laws less stringent than or otherwise different from the laws in effect in the country in which you are located. Moreover, some of the third parties described in this Policy, which provide services to us under contract, are based in other countries that may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws to the country in which you reside. Where we transfer your personal data as described above, we will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives adequate security protection where it is processed and your rights continue to be protected pursuant to the applicable data protection law, including through the use of Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission. If you would like to receive more information on the safeguards that we implement as described above, please contact us as indicated below.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Third-party websites.</strong> The Site and Applications may contain links to third-party websites. When the user follows these links, the user leaves the Site/Application, so Jippi takes no responsibility for the safety of user data during the use of third-party websites. Such websites may have their own privacy policy setting out the rules of collection and storage of user data. This Policy does not cover the data that is submitted to, stored, or used by third-party websites. We recommend that you carefully review the privacy policy of such third parties when using their websites. Jippi is not responsible for the use of your data by any third parties that you interact with in the course of using the Site or Application.</p></li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>12. Amendments</p>
        <p>12.1. This Policy may be amended or canceled by Jippi at its own discretion without prior notification of the user. We recommend that you regularly read the latest version of the Policy.</p>
        <p>12.2. A new version of the Policy is effective from the moment of its publication unless specified otherwise by such new version of the Policy.</p>
        <p>12.3. We value your trust and are always prepared to answer your questions about the handling of your personal information. If you have any questions or concerns, contact our Support Team.</p>
