        <p>When you purchase a Software license on a subscription basis, you acknowledge and agree that you are authorizing recurring payments to be made to Jippi, and those payments shall be made by the method you have chosen at the recurring intervals chosen by you until the subscription is terminated by you or by Jippi in accordance with this EULA. You will receive notice prior to each payment date, and, unless you terminate your subscription, it will be automatically renewed. Jippi will automatically charge you the then-current rate for your subscription plan, plus applicable taxes, for every billing period of your purchase order.</p>

If a debit attempt is unsuccessful, we will make another attempt on the subscription expiration date and may make such attempts again within seven (7) calendar days of the expiration date. If any of these attempts are successful, your subscription will be renewed for a new term. The new subscription period will be calculated from the next day after the end date of the previous paid period.</p>
        <p>Jippi may change your plan's rate or payment terms of your subscription each renewal term, and we will notify you of any change in advance and provide an option to cancel.</p>
